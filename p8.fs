\ p8.fs - some integer trees!
\ General strategy: parse the input into an actual tree in memory, then
\ implement operations on the tree. This turned out to be the right call for
\ part b as well.
\
\ When you see 'vaddr' below that is the base of a vector of strings,
\ represented as (c-addr, u) cell pairs in memory.

S" base.fs" included

\ Consumes one string from vaddr and converts it to an int, returning the
\ rest of vaddr, the new length of vaddr, and the converted int.
: rdint ( vaddr n -- vaddr n i )
	over 2@ s>number? drop d>s ( vaddr n i )
	-rot 1- swap 2 cells + swap rot
;

\ Consumes a tree header (two ints) from vaddr and returns the new vaddr and
\ the two parsed ints.
: rdhead ( vaddr n -- vaddr n nc nm )
	rdint -rot rdint -rot 2swap
;

\ Allocates space for a tree with nc children and nm metadata entries. The
\ tree format is simple:
\    nc [1 cell] nm [1 cell] children [nc cells] metadata [nm cells]
\ Returns the newly allocated tree.
: alloctree ( nc nm -- t )
	here { a } 2dup + 2 + cells allot
	a cell+ !
	a !
	a
;

\ Accessors for trees. These two read the numbers of children and metadata
\ entries respectively.
: nc ( tree -- n ) @ ;
: nm ( tree -- n ) cell+ @ ;

\ These return pointers into the children and metadata areas of the trees -
\ t i cp returns a pointer to the ith child slot of t, and t i mp returns a
\ pointer to the ith metadata slot of t.
: cp ( tree i -- p ) 2 + cells + ;
: mp ( tree i -- p ) 2 + over nc + cells + ;

\ This is the recursive tree-building function. It consumes part of vaddr,
\ returning the new vaddr and remaining length, and also constructs and returns
\ a new tree. The recursive calls (see RECURSE in the body) in turn consume
\ from vaddr, which takes care of skipping over the contents of child trees.
